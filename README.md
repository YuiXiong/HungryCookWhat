## Introduction
- This is a web application that fetches a random recipie from TheMealDB API.
- This application also allows user to search for recipie. 

## Tech
- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

## App instructions
type the ingredient or partial meal name in the search function and press the search icon.
click on site logo to return to home for a random recipie

## API used
https://www.themealdb.com/api.php

## Approach
I started out making the API fetch a random recipe and displaying it into a bootstrap card. Reason for using cards is so that when the user uses the search function, more cards will be displayed and thus look neater on browser. Search function was developed that brings user to a page with the ingredients, steps and a youtube video embeded for reference.

## Difficulties faced
- The usual time factor will always be acting against oneself.
- Unable to do popup display after user click which ate alot of time.
- lack of exposure of possible ways to solve problems.
- Divs and Containers have a weird interaction with innerHTML 

## WHat I wish to do if i had more time
- Styling Styling Styling!
- Do up a filter function such that user is able to filter, hide/unhide meals from other nationalities.
- seek help when I'm stuck for 1hr and document what I have tried
